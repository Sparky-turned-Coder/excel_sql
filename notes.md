# Notes for Excel Udemy Course

## Section 102

Basics of a proper formatted spreadsheet:
- Make sure you include a header of some kind.
	- This helps you and it helps excel distinguish the column headers from the actual data beneath.
- Make sure you list does not have empty rows or columns in the list.
	- If you have an empty row in the middle of your data, excel perceives this as two seperate lists.

On the ribbon, under the DATA tab, there is a "Sort & Filter" tool. Learned what this does.
- Very neat, you can sort data for specific values.
	- Example: 
		- Sort through a bunch employees to see only the ones hired in the year 1998, excluding all other years.
		- Sort to view data on specified months, excluding all the rest.
